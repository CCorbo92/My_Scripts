As of now the spreadsheet will start off as a hand curated list of a Protein Name and subtype for each PDB code. The subtype will denote different orthologs or homologs
See: "PDB_ProteinName.csv" for an example

It is important to be consistent with the Protein Name spelling and capitilization. IE Neuraminidase and Sialidase can be names given to the same protein,
but for this spreadsheet it is important to stick with one name for proteins which are intended to be familied. If in doubt Multiple Sequence Alignments
can be performed to validate correct classifications. An MSA sequence similarity of ~30% at the very least is expected.

The next step will compute DOCK descriptors and rdkit descriptors for each molecule

It is necessary to run a version of DOCK which has been compiled to be compatible with RDKit for this step
###########################
The next set of descriptors will require data accumulated from CrossDocking statistics.
